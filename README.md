### GPAWPhonopy: A Python Module for Phonon Calculations using GPAW or VASP

This module provides an interface to perform phonon calculations using either the GPAW or VASP software packages, integrating with the `Phonopy` library. 

#### Features:

- Convert between ASE atoms and Phonopy atoms seamlessly.
- Generate displaced atomic structures for phonon calculations.
- Run phonon calculations using provided scripts.
- Extract forces from GPAW or VASP calculations.
- Calculate force constants and gamma point frequencies.

---

#### Dependencies:
- os, shutil, subprocess
- numpy
- ase
- phonopy

---

#### Usage:

##### Initialization:
```python
from ase import Atoms
from GPAWPhonopy import GPAWPhonopy

# Define an Atoms object using ASE
atoms = Atoms(...)

# Initialize the GPAWPhonopy class
gp = GPAWPhonopy(atoms, repeat=[2,2,2], calc="gpaw")
```

##### Preprocess:
Generate displaced atomic structures for phonon calculations.
```python
dist_structures, phonon = gp.preprocess(atoms, distance=0.01)
```

##### Run Phonon Calculations:
This step assumes you have the required `run.py` and `submit_ph.sh` scripts available.
```python
gp.run_phonons(run="run.py", submit="submit_ph.sh")
```

##### Postprocess:
Extract forces from the calculations and compute force constants and gamma point frequencies.
```python
force_constants, gamma_frequencies = gp.postprocess()
```

#### Methods Overview:

- `ase_to_phonopy(atoms: Atoms, wrap: bool = False) -> PhonopyAtoms`:
  Convert an ASE `Atoms` object to a `PhonopyAtoms` object.
  
- `phonopy_to_ase(structure: PhonopyAtoms, info: dict = None, pbc: bool = True, db: bool = False) -> Atoms`:
  Convert a `PhonopyAtoms` object to an ASE `Atoms` object.
  
- `preprocess(atoms: Atoms, distance: float = 0.01) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Atoms], Phonopy]`:
  Generate displaced atomic structures for phonon calculations.
  
- `run_phonons(run: str = "run.py", submit: str = "submit_ph.sh") -> None`:
  Execute phonon calculations for each displaced structure.
  
- `postprocess() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]`:
  Compute force constants and gamma point frequencies from the phonon calculations.
  
- `bandstructure() -> None`:
  [TODO: Provide description when the method is implemented.]
